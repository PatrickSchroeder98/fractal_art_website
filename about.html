                <p data-i18n="about-text-1">I'm Patrick Schröder, a software engineer with a master's degree in computer science. My passion for fractals started when I got an assignment at the University of Łódź to generate the Mandelbrot set. Since then, I have been creating designs, exploring the set by zooming in on various coordinates. </p>
                <br>
                <p data-i18n="about-text-2">I also started to develop Julia set drafts as well as other fractals. My recent painting 'Anxiety' uses the shape of the Burning Ship fractal. Of course, there is more to come in the future.</p> 
                <br>
                <p data-i18n="about-text-3">The Julia set is worth mentioning here because I'm working with a version that includes a self-discovered modification, making the background shapes much more visible.</p>  
                <br>
                <p data-i18n="about-text-4">I also experiment with merging fractals with pictures. One particular achievement in this field is the draft of 'Spring Flowers.' You can see this painting printed and framed.</p>  
                <br>
                <p data-i18n="about-text-5">Now, I'm still creating various pieces of art, merging the sets and coloring them with RGB or HSV functions. The best paintings are printed and framed. The details are presented on this website.</p>
