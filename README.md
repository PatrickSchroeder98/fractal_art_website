## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure and layout of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsiveness of the website.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality, including multi-language support and interactive scaling of images and badges.

## Multi-language Implementation

The website supports translations in three languages: English (`en`), Polish (`pl`), and German (`de`). This is handled through a `translations.js` object that stores key-value pairs for each language. The keys remain the same across all languages, while the values change according to the language.

## Deployment  

The website has been deployed using GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://patrickschroeder98.github.io/fractal_art_website/index.html).
